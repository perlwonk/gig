# gig
This is an application that helps a public speaker keep all her gigs organized. When an event is scheduled, there are a number of points that need to be tracked:

* Contract - Have we sent a contract or signed one the customer created?
* Handouts - Has there been an agreement with the customer about which learning material they will purchase before hand?
* Attachments - Have we sent them a W9, promotional materials, Booking Form for gathering info about the event?
* Booking Form - Have we received the booking form containing all the event information from the customer?
* Invoice - Do we have enough information to create an initial invoice?
* Travel - Has all the travel been booked and recorded?
* Shipping - Have we recorded the all shipments where we we pay the shipping costs?  
* Shipping - Have we recorded all the shipments where the customer is paying the shipping costs?

## Green Board
* All the information above shoud appear as a "green board" when everything has been taken care of, otherwise each item will be red. 
* Each green board will be associated with a date, (the event date)
